# Regions Supporting Machine

## Overview

The **regionsSupportingMachine** configuration field defines machine type families that are not universally available across all regions. 
This configuration ensures that if a machine type family is listed, it is restricted to the explicitly specified regions, and optionally to specific zones within those regions.

If a region is listed without zones, the machine type is supported in all zones of that region.
When a new worker node pool is created, it uses the same zones as the Kyma worker node pool. If high availability (HA) is turned off, it uses just one of those zones.
For example if new worker node pool is created in `ca-central-1` with `m8g` machine type and Kyma worker node pool was provisioned in `a`, `b`, `c` zones the new worker node pool will be provisioned in `a`, `b`, `c` zones.
If HA is disabled, the new pool will be created in only one of those zones â€” for example, just zone `a`.

If zones are specified, the machine type is only available in those zones within the region.
When a new worker node pool is created, three zones are randomly selected from the list provided in the configuration. If High Availability (HA) is disabled, only one of those zones is used.
For example, if the `Standard_L` machine type is configured in the `japaneast` region with zones `[a, b, c, d]`, the worker node pool will be created in three zones such as `a`, `b`, and `c` when HA is enabled. 
If HA is disabled, it will be created in a single zone, such as `b`.

|   `Standard_L`   |  `japaneast`   |   `[a, b, c, d]`    |  `[a, b, c]`   |  true  | Worker node pool provisioned in 3 random zones, e.g., `a`, `b`, `d` |
